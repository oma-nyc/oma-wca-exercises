## Synopsis

Pete's prompts for learning how to do great prompting!

## Prompts

### Simple python example

Create a python class Customer. Include attributes for firstName, lastName, and age.

### Rust example

You are a Rust programmer. Generate a Rust struct named SshFactory for managing SSH connections. The struct should have fields for inventory, a flag to forward the SSH agent, and an optional login password. Implement the ConnectionFactory trait with methods get_local_connection and get_connection to create local and remote SSH connections, respectively. Use the ssh2 crate for SSH functionality and ensure the code is thread-safe with appropriate use of Arc and RwLock.

### K8s example

You are a platform engineer. Generate a Kubernetes Deployment for nginx 1.25 in namespace web, 2 replicas, CPU 250m, memory 256Mi, plus a ClusterIP Service.

### MQ-OCP example

You are an Ansible and OpenShift engineer. Begin creating a role called pnuw/mq-ocp that deploys IBM MQ on OpenShift 4 with an exposed route.
